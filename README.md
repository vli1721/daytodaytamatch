# encounter++
encounter++ is a web app that enables nearby students to meet their peers based on their common statuses (current activities such as eating, working, studying, or playing), interests, and classes.

After a student registers for an account and enters information about his/her classes and interests, he/she can submit a status (given several general options - work, play, eat - and more specific ones) and location update and subsequently find up to 3 other users who are online at the same time with a similar status, within 0.5 miles of him/her.

If a user enters a general status of "work," our algorithm searches for nearby users who have at least one common class. Similarly, if a user enters a general status of "play" or "eat", our algorithm searches for nearby users who have at least one common interest. Otherwise, with more specific statuses, our algorithm searches more generally to yield more results.
